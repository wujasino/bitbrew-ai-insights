# Presora

AI brand-visibility SaaS. React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui,
Netlify serverless functions, Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage).

## Brand palette (dark mode, app-wide)

- Background `#0B0F19` · Card `#111827` · Border `#334155`
- Text `#F8FAFC` · Muted text `#94A3B8`
- Primary / CTA / logo `#6366F1`, hover `#4F46E5`
- Secondary button (e.g. login) `#1E293B` bg + `#F8FAFC` text

Tokens live in `src/index.css` under `.dark`.

Decorative/repeating chrome (`.hero`, `.badge`, `.cta-box` gradients in
`src/index.css`, and `GradientMeshBg`'s hero orbs) was deliberately toned
down from indigo/violet to neutral graphite — indigo stayed reserved for
actionable elements: `--primary` (buttons, links, focus rings, the 1/2/3
step-number circles on Landing) and `.ai-presence-accent` (the "AI
visibility audit" chromatic hero accent, the one signature moment). Don't
casually re-add indigo tints to background/wash classes; that's undoing an
intentional "vivid identity in some places, neutral everywhere else" split.

## Logo mark

New as of the "ribbon P" redesign (replaced the old solid-indigo glyph).
The source files the user provided (`public/presora-icon-512-dark.png`,
`public/presora-icon-512-white.png`) are flat opaque squares with the
glyph baked in at a dark charcoal color (~`rgb(50,51,56)`) — not directly
usable as an app icon, and that charcoal reads at under 2:1 contrast
against the app's dark backgrounds (effectively invisible).

Derived, actually-used assets:
- `public/presora-mark.png` — copy of `presora-icon-512-white.png`,
  used only for the JSON-LD Organization `"logo"` field in `index.html`
  (expects a plain/light background).
- `public/presora-mark-new.png` — the glyph alpha-masked out to a
  transparent PNG, original charcoal color. For light backgrounds.
- `public/presora-mark-new-dark.png` — same transparent glyph, recolored
  to `--foreground` (`#F8FAFC`). For dark backgrounds.
- `Wordmark.tsx` renders both of the last two, toggled via Tailwind's
  `dark:` variant (no theme hook needed) — mirrors `useFaviconTheme.ts`'s
  light/dark favicon swap, which now also uses the new mark (composited
  onto `#0F0F23` for the `-dark` favicon sizes, replacing the old
  indigo-era ones).

If new master logo files ever replace these again: re-extract the
transparent variants the same way (alpha = luminance-based masking
against the flat background) rather than trying to reuse the opaque
squares directly — see git history around "Use the new logo mark in the
navbar" for the exact approach.

## Landing page (`src/pages/Landing.tsx`)

Defaults to dark (via `ThemeProvider`'s `defaultTheme="dark"` in
`main.tsx`, same as the rest of the app) but is now toggleable — the
`Navbar` takes a `showThemeToggle` prop (only Landing passes it; other
pages using the shared `Navbar` like Terms/Privacy have dark-hardcoded
inline content and would break if toggled). Uses the same palette as the
rest of the app (see Brand palette above, incl. the indigo-vs-neutral
split) plus the `"mono"` `GradientMeshBg` orb variant for the hero
(grayscale — was `"indigo"`, changed together with the palette toning).
`.font-landing` sets Plus Jakarta Sans for body/paragraph text only;
headings (`.font-display`) deliberately fall through to the app-wide
Space Grotesk instead of being overridden, so headings read as the same
family as the wordmark next to the logo mark.

Landing-specific CSS classes with hand-picked colors (`.hero`, `.badge`,
`.cta-box`, `.ai-presence-accent*` in `src/index.css`) each need both a
base (light) and `.dark` override — previously they were dark-only since
the page force-applied `.dark` regardless of the resolved theme.
`useForceDarkTheme()` was removed when the toggle was added; don't
re-add hardcoded dark-only colors on Landing without a light pairing.

## Wordmark font

`.font-wordmark` (in `src/index.css`) uses **Space Grotesk** at semibold
(600) — chosen to pair with the new "ribbon P" logo mark's geometric-but-
fluid shape; Michroma's rigid, blocky letterforms (the previous choice,
matched to the old Rimac-Nevera-style glyph) read as too robotic next to
it. Space Grotesk is already loaded app-wide for `.font-display`
(headings), so this doesn't add a new font fetch, and it now also drives
the Landing hero headline (see Landing page section above) for a
consistent mark+wordmark+headline family. Rendered uppercase via
`Wordmark.tsx` (`uppercase tracking-wide font-semibold`). Loaded via the
main Google Fonts `<link>` in `index.html`. Previously tried Michroma,
Fraunces (Casko substitute) and Satoshi (via Fontshare) — all replaced.

## Social assets

`public/social/presora-avatar.png` (1024×1024, solid indigo gradient bg)
and `presora-banner.png` (1500×500, X/Twitter header size, dark navy +
dot-grid + glow, wordmark in Unbounded font) — regenerate via a Playwright
HTML render (see git history around the "Add social media avatar and
banner assets" commit for the approach) if the palette or copy changes.

## Enterprise SSO (SAML 2.0)

Foundation only — no UI entry point is wired up yet (removed on purpose,
"sam kod, bez przycisku"). `src/lib/samlAuth.ts` exports
`signInWithSSODomain(domain)`, and `Login.tsx` has a ready `sso` mode panel
(domain input → redirects to the IdP) that isn't linked from anywhere in
the visible UI — re-add a button/link calling `switchMode('sso', 1)` when
this is ready to ship.

Supabase Auth acts as the SAML Service Provider. Presora's SP metadata URL
(give this to a customer's IdP admin to set up trust) is:
`https://wxwdymchrmhxeiccnzg.supabase.co/auth/v1/sso/saml/metadata`

To actually register a connection for a customer's domain: the Supabase
project needs the SSO add-on enabled (Team/Enterprise), then run
`supabase sso add --type saml --metadata-url <their IdP metadata URL>
--domains their-company.com` via the Supabase CLI with project-linked
credentials — not doable from this sandbox (no CLI auth, no real project
ref access beyond what's hardcoded in `netlify.toml`'s redirect).

## Feature flags (`app_settings`)

Runtime toggles an admin flips without a redeploy, in `public.app_settings`
(key/jsonb, migration `20240133`). RLS is on with **no policies** — it's
unreachable with an anon/authenticated JWT; only service-role Functions
touch it.

- `scanning_enabled` — master kill-switch for brand scanning. Read via
  `netlify/functions/_lib/appSettings.js`'s `isScanningEnabled()` in
  `analyze.js`, `api-analyze.js` and `check-score-alerts.js`; written only
  by `toggle-scanning.js` (verifies `profiles.is_admin`). UI at
  `/admin/settings`.
- `isScanningEnabled()` **fails open** on a missing row or query error —
  it's a deliberate off-switch, not a security control, so a DB hiccup must
  never take scanning down by itself.
- In `analyze.js` the check sits *before* the guest-limit RPC on purpose, so
  a paused scanner never burns a visitor's free allowance. Verified: with
  the flag off, zero OpenRouter calls and the guest counter untouched.
- **Watchdog**: `recordScanOutcome()` counts consecutive all-models-failed
  scans in `provider_failures` and flips `scanning_enabled` off at
  `AUTO_DISABLE_THRESHOLD` (3), recording why in `scanning_disabled_reason`
  (`source: 'auto' | 'manual'`). A success resets the streak. It never
  re-enables itself — auto-recovery would flap (enable → fail → disable) and
  each cycle costs real users a broken scan; an admin turns it back on once
  the cause is fixed, which also clears the counter.
- `getScanSettings()` reads all three keys in one query and hands the count
  to `recordScanOutcome()`, so the happy path adds no extra round-trip.

## Admin account management

`/admin/settings` (`AdminSettings.tsx`) → `admin-update-user.js`: look an
account up by email and change `plan`, `credits`, or reset the monthly usage
counter. All three are service-role-only writes gated on the caller's
`profiles.is_admin`.

**Why they're service-role-only** (migration `20240134`): `profiles`' UPDATE
policy is `USING (auth.uid() = id)` with no column restriction, and
`protect_plan_changes()` originally guarded only `plan`/`is_admin`/the price
columns. `credits` (bought via Stripe payment links, granted by referrals)
and `analyses_this_month`/`analyses_reset_at` (what
`enforce_analysis_limit()` meters against) were left open — any signed-in
user could grant themselves credits or zero their usage from the browser
console. The trigger now guards all of them. Don't add a new paid-usage
column to `profiles` without adding it to that trigger too.

## Known sandbox limitations

- No real internet in this dev/test sandbox except through the proxy —
  `fonts.googleapis.com` and `fonts.gstatic.com` work fine via `curl` and
  in Playwright/Chromium. If a webfont looks wrong in a screenshot, don't
  assume proxy flakiness — check for a stale/corrupted cached font file in
  `/tmp` first (re-`curl` it fresh) before suspecting the network.
- Supabase MCP has **write** access (verified: `apply_migration` applied
  20240133/20240134 successfully). It's been read-only in some earlier
  sessions when the connector wasn't authorised — if `list_tables` errors,
  fall back to handing the user SQL for the Dashboard editor, but try
  first rather than assuming.
- Useful pattern for proving an RLS/trigger hole before and after a fix:
  `BEGIN; SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims = '{"sub":"...","role":"authenticated"}';
  <attack>; ROLLBACK;`. Note `auth.role()` reads the **JWT claim**, not the
  Postgres session role — `SET LOCAL ROLE service_role` alone won't make
  `auth.role()` return `service_role`, and a leftover claim from an earlier
  statement in the same transaction will silently skew the next test.
- GitHub PR for this branch has been merged mid-session more than once —
  always check `git log origin/main` before pushing; if merged, restart
  from `origin/main` and cherry-pick any unmerged commits back on top.

## Notes vault

`notes/` is also set up as an Obsidian vault (paired with the Obsidian Git
plugin on the user's machine) for longer-form/browsable notes. This file
(`CLAUDE.md`) is for things Claude should remember automatically every
session — use `notes/` for anything meant to be read as prose in Obsidian.
