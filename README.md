[Presora](https://presora.app) is a production SaaS that tracks brand visibility in
AI-generated answers — built end-to-end by me, frontend through backend through
infrastructure (see [What it does](#what-it-does) and [Tech stack](#tech-stack) below).
This repo's other half is the Playwright test suite covering it: E2E coverage of
authentication, the dashboard's real data, subscription state in Settings and the
command palette, plus API contract tests against the serverless functions themselves
(payload validation, rate limiting, error codes) — see [Testing](#testing) for the
full breakdown and real numbers.

**App stack:** React · TypeScript · Supabase · Netlify Functions · Stripe
**Test stack:** Playwright · TypeScript · GitHub Actions

---

## What it does

- **Brand visibility audits** — scores a brand across authority, sentiment, recency, mentions and accuracy, with per-model breakdowns
- **RAG-grounded analysis** — brand knowledge is embedded (Voyage `voyage-3.5`) and stored in Supabase pgvector, then retrieved into the prompt so results stay specific instead of generic
- **AI assistant with tool calling** — a chat interface that configures monitoring (brand, competitors, cadence, alert thresholds) by writing to the database through structured tools, no forms required
- **Automations & monitoring** — recurring brand monitors with alert metrics and thresholds, one config per user
- **Embeddable score badge** — a public SVG endpoint (`/.netlify/functions/badge?brand=…`) that any site can drop in
- **Reports & PDF viewer** — audits rendered as shareable reports
- **Voice playback** — report narration via ElevenLabs multilingual TTS
- **Full account layer** — email + Google OAuth sign-in, OTP password reset, recovery codes, avatars, newsletter preferences
- **Billing** — Stripe checkout for monthly/yearly plans and credit packs, with webhook-driven plan sync
- **6 UI languages** — EN, PL, DE, ES, FR, IT
- **Public status page** — live health check of the app and Supabase Auth/DB reachability, no fabricated uptime numbers
- **Contact page** — a real form (name, email, subject, message) backed by its own rate-limited serverless endpoint

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|--------------|
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui (Radix), React Router, TanStack Query |
| Visualisation | Recharts, three.js / react-force-graph-3d, Framer Motion |
| Backend | Node.js on Netlify serverless functions (23 endpoints) |
| Data & Auth | Supabase — PostgreSQL, pgvector, Auth, Row-Level Security, Storage |
| AI | Anthropic Claude (analysis + tool-calling assistant), Voyage AI embeddings, ElevenLabs TTS |
| Payments | Stripe — checkout, customer portal, webhook-driven plan upgrades |
| Email | Resend (transactional), Mailchimp (newsletter) |
| Testing | Vitest + Testing Library (unit), Playwright (E2E + API contract) |
| Infra | Netlify CI/CD, custom domain & DNS, Google OAuth proxy redirect |

## Engineering highlights

- **RAG pipeline end-to-end** — ingestion function, chunking, Voyage embeddings, pgvector similarity search, context injection into the analysis prompt
- **Tool-calling agent** — the chat assistant reads and upserts monitoring config through typed tools, with the serverless function scoping every write to the JWT-verified user id
- **Defense in depth on data access** — RLS policies on every user-owned table (analyses, monitors, recovery codes, newsletter, rate limits), plus service-role functions that never trust a client-supplied user id
- **Layered rate limiting** — per-user windows and daily caps enforced in Postgres, with an in-memory limiter as a secondary guard, and a separate guest quota path for unauthenticated trials
- **Auth hardening** — OTP-based password reset with attempt lockout, one-time recovery codes, Google OAuth routed through a Netlify proxy so the Supabase project ref never leaks into the browser
- **Production security headers** — strict CSP with an explicit allow-list, HSTS preload, frame denial, MIME sniff protection, scoped Permissions-Policy
- **Cache strategy tuned per asset class** — immutable hashing for build output, revalidation for images, no-store for HTML
- **11 versioned SQL migrations** covering schema, policies, triggers and storage buckets
- **Shipped and debugged in production** across auth, serverless runtime limits, Stripe webhooks and third-party API failures
- **Error monitoring & analytics ready, opt-in** — Sentry and Plausible are wired up but inert until `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` / `VITE_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN` are set, so nothing ships half-configured or points at a fake project

## Project structure

```
netlify/functions/   23 serverless endpoints (analyze, chat, ingest-knowledge,
                     stripe-webhook, badge, tts, auth/OTP, newsletter, …)
src/pages/           25 routes — Landing, Dashboard, Reports, Automations,
                     Pricing, Developers, ApiDocs, Settings, auth flows
src/lib/             Supabase client, auth, brand scoring, i18n + 6 locales
src/components/      shadcn/ui-based component layer
supabase/migrations/ schema, RLS policies, triggers, storage buckets
```

## Running locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wujasino/presora.git
cd presora
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
cp .env.example .env      # fill in the keys below
npx netlify dev           # app on :8888, functions included
```

Frontend-only (`npm run dev`, port 4000) works, but any route hitting `/.netlify/functions/*` needs `netlify dev`.

```

## Testing

Presora is a production SaaS handling authentication, LLM-driven analysis pipelines and Stripe subscriptions, so the suite is built around the paths where a regression costs real money: sign-in/sign-up, the dashboard's real data, subscription state in Settings, and the request contracts of the serverless functions everything else is built on.

**72 tests, ~96–101s per CI shard** (measured on a real GitHub Actions run, 2-way sharded — [see the check runs](https://github.com/wujasino/presora/pull/121/checks)). Flake check: `npx playwright test --project=chromium --project=api --repeat-each=10` — **470 repeated runs (24 UI + 23 API tests × 10), 0 failures.**

**Unit test coverage — the honest number:** `npm run test:coverage` measures **1.3% of `src/` by statement**. That's not a typo or a mistake to fix — Vitest here only has 2 files to run (`src/test/`), and they exercise one thing on purpose: `src/lib/locale.tsx`'s i18n logic (74% statement coverage on that file, 100% on the `en`/`pl`/`de` dictionaries). Everything a unit test would normally check on a page or component — does it render, does clicking a button do the right thing, does a bad API response degrade gracefully — is checked by the 72-test Playwright suite above instead, against real rendered output and real (or precisely mocked) network responses, which is a stronger guarantee for that kind of behavior than a component test with everything mocked out would be. A 1.3% unit-coverage number next to a 72-test integration/API suite is what that division of labor looks like measured honestly, not a gap to close.

| Layer | Tool |
|-------|------|
| End-to-end (UI) | Playwright + TypeScript, Page Object Model |
| API contract | Playwright's `request` fixture against the real Netlify Function handlers |
| Unit | Vitest + Testing Library |
| CI | GitHub Actions, 2-way sharded, manual dispatch + nightly schedule — never gates a merge or deploy |

**What is covered** (72 tests: 49 UI × chromium + mobile-chrome, 23 API contract — `e2e/`)

- **Authentication** — successful login, rejection of bad credentials, required-field validation, the forgot-password → OTP-code flow, signup (success, password-mismatch validation, "already registered" failure), and unauthenticated visitors getting redirected off protected routes.
- **Dashboard** — the real per-model AI confidence data (`analyses.sources`) rendering correctly, a `–` placeholder instead of a fabricated number when that data is missing, and the account menu/sign-out flow.
- **Settings** — a canceled subscription showing its status and a working *Resume* button, an active subscription showing no cancellation banner, the referral panel (happy path and a failed lookup degrading to an inline error instead of a crash), and tab navigation.
- **Command palette** — the ⌘K/Ctrl+K global search opens, filters, navigates, and closes on Escape, with an assertion that it never trips a Radix accessibility warning.
- **Public pages** — Landing, Pricing, About, Contact, Status render with zero console errors.
- **API contracts** (`e2e/api/`, against `contact.js`, `newsletter.js`, `newsletter-preference.js`) — method allow-lists (405), malformed-JSON and field validation (400), payload-size limits (413), auth requirements (401), rate limiting kicking in on the 6th request from one IP within the window (429), CORS never reflecting an untrusted `Origin`, and — the part that matters most — a real unreachable-Supabase-host failure degrading to a clean JSON error instead of crashing the handler.

**Design decisions**

- **No live backend or test account required.** UI tests mock Supabase Auth/REST and the Netlify Functions layer at the network level (`e2e/mocks/supabase.ts`) instead of hitting a real Supabase project — deterministic, runs in CI with zero secrets, and lets edge cases (a canceled subscription, a 500 from an API) be asserted directly rather than reproduced by hand. `auth.setup.ts` still drives the real login form once, against a mocked `/auth/v1/token` response, and persists the resulting session via `storageState` for every other UI spec to reuse.
- **API tests run the real function code, not a mock.** `e2e/api/functionServer.ts` wraps each Netlify Function's actual `exports.handler` in a throwaway local HTTP server, so Playwright's `request` fixture hits genuine code — no `netlify dev`, no real Supabase/Stripe credentials, since the contracts under test (validation, rate limiting, method/CORS handling) all run before any real backend call. Where a test needs to see how the *real* backend call fails (an unreachable Supabase host), it points at one and lets the real network error happen.
- **PostgREST-shape-aware mocks.** supabase-js sends a different `Accept` header for `.single()`/`.maybeSingle()` queries and expects a bare object back, not an array — the UI mocks inspect that header and respond with the shape the caller actually expects.
- **Role-based locators first.** `getByRole` / `getByLabel` over CSS selectors, so the tests survive refactors and surface accessibility problems as failures — this is how two of the bugs below were found.
- **No `waitForTimeout` anywhere.** Tests wait on element state, URL changes, and network responses (real or mocked) rather than fixed delays.
- **Console-error fixture.** A shared `consoleIssues` fixture (`e2e/fixtures.ts`) collects uncaught page errors and `console.error` calls per test, so regressions that don't fail an assertion but do throw silently still get caught.
- **Failures are debuggable.** Traces on first retry, screenshots and video on failure, all uploaded as CI artifacts.

**Bugs found and fixed while building the suite**

- `Login.tsx`/`Register.tsx` had `<Label>` elements never associated to their `<Input>` via `htmlFor`/`id` — invisible to `getByLabel()` and to screen readers alike, despite looking correctly labeled.
- Signing out from a protected page could silently land on `/login` instead of the landing page: `signOut()` fires an auth-state-change partway through its own promise chain, which `ProtectedRoute` (still mounted at that moment) reacts to with its own redirect — a race the explicit `navigate('/')` call could lose non-deterministically.
- `netlify/functions/*.js` is written in CommonJS (`exports.handler`), but the repo root's `package.json` says `"type": "module"` — Netlify's own bundler tolerates the mix, but any plain Node tooling (including this test suite's own function-server harness) tried to load the files as ES modules and got back an object with no `.handler`. Fixed with a nested `netlify/functions/package.json` declaring `{"type": "commonjs"}`, which is the standard fix for exactly this split and makes the functions loadable outside Netlify's bundler too.

**Running locally**

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium

# The suite never calls a real backend, so any non-empty Supabase URL/key
# unblocks the app's own startup check:
echo 'VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://placeholder.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=placeholder' > .env.local

npm run e2e                        # everything: UI (chromium + mobile-chrome) + API contracts
npm run e2e -- --project=api       # just the API contract tests — no browser, no dev server needed
npm run e2e:ui                     # interactive runner
npm run e2e:report                 # open the last HTML report
```

Set `BASE_URL` to point the UI projects at a deployed preview instead of the local dev server — the `api` project is unaffected, since it never talks to a URL at all, only to the function handlers directly.
